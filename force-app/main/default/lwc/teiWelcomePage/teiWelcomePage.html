            <div>
                On February 25, 1983, the Treasury Secretary established the Treasury Executive Institute to serve Treasury’s SES learning and networking needs. In 2002, TEI became interagency; and in 2014, TEI joined the Treasury Franchise Fund, becoming a shared service. The GS-14 and GS-15 employees of our partner agencies are also now part of TEI.
