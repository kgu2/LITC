    "description": "Developing the careers of others is a critical skill leaders must effectively master to sustain the growth of future leaders and their organizations. Engaging employees about their future goals, plans and desires is a great first step to helping them create the future they want. An employee's strengths and opportunity areas factor into career development, and the future direction and long-term needs of the organization should also steer an employee's development activities. While leaders provide the opportunity to discuss an employee's future career development plans, the ultimate responsibility rests with the employee. The resources on this page provide a great starting point to get career development conversations started and development plans initiated.",
