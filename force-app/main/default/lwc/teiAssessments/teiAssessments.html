          <strong>Self-assessments</strong> offer an opportunity to self-evaluate an aspect of yourself or perspective. Depending on the assessment, you can evaluate your work interactions, preferences, knowledge of an area, and styles. Often, these assessments provide a comparison of your results to a norm group to gain perspective.

          <strong>360 Assessments</strong> gather input from your supervisor, direct reports (if applicable), peers, others, and a self-evaluation. The multisource feedback can cover various leadership areas such as leadership, teamwork, emotional intelligence, communication, and many more. The report created by the 360 feedback can be used in several ways for one’s individual leadership development, including creating an Individual Development Plan and working with a coach.
